              I teach energy-balancing, nurturing Vinyasa yoga in the lineage of Dr. Liz Lindh and T.K.S. Desikachar. I combine scientific and intuitive knowledge to help my students connect with the forces within and around them. <b>A focus of my yoga is counteracting the physical, mental, and spiritual stressors encountered by scientists, academics, and other professionals and intellectuals.</b>

              My personal mission is to help people to be better stewards of the Earth, themselves, and each other. I achieve this by exploring the connections between life and the Earth (through my work as a marine biogeochemist), empowering the next generation of leaders and thinkers in the environmental sciences (as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California), and cultivating a culture of wellness in academia (as a yoga teacher and holder of space).

              I am a RYT-200. I also hold a PhD in microbial biogeochemistry and chemical oceanography from MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  I am newly based in the Los Angeles area.

            Praise for Goddess Workshops<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class='smallheader'>
              "It was a journey of self-discovery and empowerment, leaving us feeling more in tune with our bodies and spirits. The workshop was a beautiful blend of yoga, meditation, and self-reflection. It's difficult to pick just one favorite part, as the entire workshop was exceptional. However, the guided breathing and exercises during the workshop were particularly profound. They allowed us to tap into our inner strength." - Bea G.            </p>
            </p>
            <p class='smallheader'>
              "You can feel her dedication in every session, especially in the well-thought-out Goddess Workshop, which for me was a truly empowering experience. Noelle is not just an experienced and kind guide in her yoga expertise, but she brings so many extra touches to her lessons that really make practicing with her special. Her curated playlists really create a vibe that resonates with the rhythm of the practice and her pumpkin bread is just beyond good – adding an extra layer of joy to the post-yoga bliss." - Anna W.

              "-	When I saw the announcement for Noelle's Goddess Power Workshop I wasn't sure what to expect but it somehow immediately spoke to me. I knew from the minute I arrived that this would be exactly what I needed: guidance and inspiration to calm down, reconnect with my body and my spiritual self. The harmoniously decorated room and the atmosphere of serenity, kindness and peace that were created by Noelle and enhanced by the other participating women profoundly moved me. Noelle guided us through a well-balanced sequence of yoga practices, meditation and dancing, each element interwoven with spiritual wisdom that made the journey deeply touching and inspiring." - Olga S.
