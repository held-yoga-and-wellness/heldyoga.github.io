              I teach energy-balancing, nurturing Vinyasa yoga in the lineage of Dr. Liz Lindh and T.K.S. Desikachar. I combine scientific and intuitive knowledge to help my students connect with the forces within and around them. <b>A focus of my yoga is counteracting the physical, mental, and spiritual stressors encountered by scientists, academics, and other intellectuals.</b>

              My personal mission is to help people to be better stewards of the Earth, themselves, and each other. I achieve this by exploring the connections between life and the Earth (through my work as a marine biogeochemist), empowering the next generation of leaders and thinkers in the environmental sciences (as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California), and cultivating a culture of wellness in academia (as a yoga teacher and holder of space).

              I am a RYT-200. I also hold a PhD in microbial biogeochemistry and chemical oceanography from MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  I am currently based in Zurich, Switzerland and from January 2024 will be in the Los Angeles area.
