              I teach energy-balancing, nurturing Vinyasa yoga in the lineage of Dr. Liz Lindh and T.K.S. Desikachar. I combine scientific and intuitive knowledge to help my students connect with the forces within and around them. <b>A focus of my yoga is counteracting the physical, mental, and spiritual stressors encountered by scientists, academics, and other intellectuals.</b>

              My personal mission is to help people to be better stewards of the Earth, themselves, and each other. I achieve this by exploring the connections between life and the Earth (through my work as a marine biogeochemist), empowering the next generation of leaders and thinkers in the environmental sciences (as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California), and cultivating a culture of wellness in academia (as a yoga teacher and holder of space).

            Praise for Goddess Workshops<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class='smallheader'>
                "What truly sets her practice apart is her profound understanding of the intrinsic power within each yoga pose, and how intentionally she can craft sequences aligned with the purpose of a session. I also deeply appreciate how beautifully she blends spirituality with the physical practice, which is very helpful for me to anchor in the present moment. Through little details, she would make every class unique and exciting, like reading a little poet, mantra or an essay in her beautiful voice, all of which resonates with the theme of day. She would than switch up the lighting, use a drop of an essential oil for relaxation or focus, even introducing creative elements like free dance sequencesâ€”each thoughtful gesture adds depth and excitement to her sessions. " - Sema K.

              "I have only visited 3 or 4 yoga sessions, but all of them were profoundly different to my previous yoga-experiences. Noelle included a variety of different yoga aspects, from breathing techniques to interesting positions to mindful exercises. The time flew by (which it normally does not for me) and I really enjoyed it! All my senses were stimulated; the music was timed with the program, there were explanations, quotes and translations that I absolutely loved, Christmas lights in a dimmed room, candles and smells. Noelle has the ability to make you feel completely comfortable. I am grateful that I was able to take this journey together with Noelle." - Lea C.             </p>

            <p class='smallheader'>
                "Noelle is an exceptionally gifted teacher and I wholeheartedly recommend her classes and workshops to anyone seeking to practice yoga and connecting to their inner spiritual self." - Olga S.
