# How to add your profile to the lab webpage

## Fork the webpage
1. While logged into your own github account, navigate to the github page for the website and click "Fork," "create a new fork." 
2. Github will automatically create a copy of the code in your own github account, and will navigate you there.

## Create a branch
3. In your own fork of the repository (you should automatically be navigated there), click the branch "main," and type YourName (this is the name of the branch)
4. Click "create branch" to create your branch of the repository.

## Add your markdown page
5. Navigate to the people folder. Click on the "testperson.md" file. Click the copy icon to copy the code to your clipboard.
6. In the people folder, click "add file" then "create new file" and give it the name FirstNameLastName.md
7. Paste the previously copied code into the file
8. Add your personal information to the markdown page; follow instructions in the code.
9. Scroll down and add a commit message such as "create [your name]" then commit the code directly to your branch. 

## Add your photo
10. Navigate to the "assets/img/people" folder of the repository. 
11. Be sure you are still in the YourName branch of the repo. 
12. Click "add file" then "upload files" and upload a small, squareish PNG image of yourself in the format FirstNameLastName.png

## Create a pull request to the original repo
10. Once you've committed your markdown page and photo, a pop up will appear that says "this branch is X commits ahead of proteoceanLab:main"
11. Click "contribute" then "open pull request" on this pop up.
12. Create the pull request
13. Congrats! Noelle will review your pull request and add you to the webpage.
