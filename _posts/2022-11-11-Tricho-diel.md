<i>Trichodesmium</i> is unique among nitrogen fixers. It fixes nitrogen and carbon simultaneously. This is risky behavior - why would <i>Trichodesmium </i> do this? 

The project used <b> cell culturing, physiology, label-free protoemics, quantitative proteomics, GC-MS, mathematical modeling </b>and <b>network analysis</b>.

[This work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01028-1) was published in 2022. There is a much larger body of literature/debate about how <i> Trichodesmium </i> manages nitrogen fixation and carbon fixation simultaneously during the photoperiod. You can review snippets of this debate [here](https://consensus.app/results/?q=trichodesmium%20nitrogen%20fixation%20during%20the%20day). Clearly there is more to understand about <i>Trichodesmium's </i> molecular physiology, and we plan to continue investigating!
