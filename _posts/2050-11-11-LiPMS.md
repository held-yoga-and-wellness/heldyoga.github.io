Proteins are the literal molecular machines that perform biochemical transformations within cells and connect the inner life of cells to the external environment. Protein activity, particularly of key enzymes such as the photosynthetic enzymes and nitrogenase, is an important biogeochemical parameter.

Protein activity can be modulated by changes in protein concentration (as we can measure through proteomics), but also through changes in protein 3D shape. Protein 3D shape can change dynamically over time due to protein-metabolite interactions, protein-protein interactions, and post translational modifications. 

We are developing conceptually simple strategies to measure protein conformational changes in marine microbes. We work with collaborators at [ETH-Zurich](https://imsb.ethz.ch/research/picotti.html) to acheive this. 

The project uses <b> LC-MS based proteomics, statistical analyses, physiology, </b>and <b>cell culturing</b>.
