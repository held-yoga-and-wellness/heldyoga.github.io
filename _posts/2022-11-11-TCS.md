---
Two component sensors are the biochemical senses of the cell. It is the most common form of molecular bacterial sensing. How do these systems work in marine bacteria and what is their role in biogeochemical cycles? 

The project used <b>genome analysis, metaproteomics, </b>and <b>statistical surveys</b> to look into this question.

[This work](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/mSystems.00317-18) was published in 2019. No current follow up projects are started, but the concept remains of interest!
