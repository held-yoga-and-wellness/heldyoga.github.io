Under the microscope, <i>Trichodesmium</i> colonies vary a lot! How does is this reflected in their molecular profiles?

The project used <b>metaproteomics of single colonies, microscopy, </b>and <b> synchrotron-based Î¼-XRF</b> to look into this question.

[This work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43705-021-00034-y) was published in 2021. We're following up on individual heterogeneity in marine microbes using microfluidics and microscopy techniques, and using what we learned in this project to improve techniques for metaproteomics analyses of limited-biomass samples.
