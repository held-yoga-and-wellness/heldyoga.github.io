description: "Which nutrient limits the growth of <i>Trichodesmium</i> in nature?"
---
<i>Trichodesmium,</i> a keystone marine microbe, can fix a theoretically unlimited supply of carbon and nitrogen; therefore the next most-limiting nutrients Fe and P seem to limit its growth and activity. Which nutrient limits <i>Trichodesmium</i> in nature? 

The project used <b>metaproteomics, quantitative proteomics, mathematical modelling, </b>and <b>network analysis</b>.

[This work](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/2537/2020/) was published in 2020. The  transcript abundances from some of the same transects reflect different patterns - an interesting comparison that can be found [here (Cerdan-Garcia et al., 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-021-01151-1). I also recommend this nice study considering similar trade offs in nutrient acquisition by phytoplankton [here (McCain et al., 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abg6501).
