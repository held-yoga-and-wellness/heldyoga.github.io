description: "What is the intuition behind nutrient colimitation?"
---
Nutrient availability is a key control on the growth and activity of microbes. Usually nutrient limitations are considered individually, but this ignores the reality of nature: often, many nutrients are simultaneously deplete. 

Our understanding of the phenomenon of microbial growth when multiple nutrients are dilute is limited by lack of a unifed framework. Together with our collaborators at [Rutgers University](https://qevomicrolab.org/) and [ETH Zurich](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.MjU3OTkz.TGlzdC82MzcsMzIwMTk3MjIy.html), we are working to fill that gap. 

Further work will focus on the molecular basis and biogeochemical implications of nutrient colimitation. 

The project uses <b> mathematical modelling, concepts in theoretical biology, physiology </b>and <b>molecular analysis</b>.
